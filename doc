what is ray casting?
::
it is a way to transform  a limited form of data (create a 3d view using data)
by tarcing rays from the view point into the view volume (rays of light hit the walls
get turn to wall if collide happen or empty space in case of none)
and it is not possible to move in z axis using ray-casting because it put a geaomastic constriants
{
    1. Walls are always at 90Â° angle with the floor.
    2. Walls are made of cubes that have the same size.
    3. Floor is always flat.
}

BUILT THE WORLD
::
the size of cube wil be  64x64x64 units:
    it was chosing becuase I chose to do sheft opertations
    and for that it need to be devide by 2this faster than noral arithmetic;
    -The larger the size of the cube, the blockier the world will look like
    but smaller cube will make the rendering slower
chose ow ou move in axis

now we need:
    palyer hight (how high the player view the wold) = 32
    player FOV (field of view) = 60
    player position:
    {
        take x coordinate 
        y coordinate
        the angle the player facing:N, S, W, E
    }
    Relationship between player and projection plane (???)

    the window size: 320 wide and 200 high
now we calculate:
    size of window: 320*200;
    middle = 160, 100;
    angel between colum and how to loop = 60/320 = 1 colum
    distance from player to the project planer 160 /30 = 277
